Breddie's Dotfiles
==================

These dotfiles are made with Arch/Arch-based distributions in mind. I prefer Arch for its volatile package management and overall simplicity and straightforwardness. If you are going to use these dotfiles for other distributions, it would work fine, but just remember to satiate the pre-requisites.

Secondly, this is made specifically for Xfce+Herbstluftwm, oriented to my personal workflow. Keep that in your head.
