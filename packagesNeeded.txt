This list is made with Arch/Artix in mind (coz I sold my soul to rolling releases and community made patches). Godspeed fellers

PREREQUISITES
-------------
1. vim
2. git
3. base-devel
4. if artix, MAKE SURE YOU EDIT THE pacman.conf to include the arch community/extra repos

Main
----
1. herbstluftwm
2. alacritty
3. dunst
4. picom
5. rofi
6. yay
7. ttf-jetbrains-mono
8. xfce4 - xfce4-panel (searching for a reliable way to get dotfiles/skim the cream)
9. qt5ct

Pleasure
-----
playerctl
mpv
zathura
steam (needs lib32 repo enabled)
spotify (electron, yuck) / spotify clients

Plans
------
xmonad/xmobar shift alternate setup
remove the need of xfce-panel (esp for the brightness and volume keys, I don't think the other modules really matter to me)) (or atleast see how to hide it)

Lelouch-tier Cheesy Plans
-------------------------
Learn -> C++
	Haskell
	Rust
	Fortran
